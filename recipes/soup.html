        <h2>Rich and creamy Hungarian mushroom soup</h2>
        <p>This Hungarian mushroom soup has lots of flavor and is fairly quick to make. It's primarily a mushroom soup but derives a lot of its flavor from other ingredients. My family loves soup and this is one of their favorites. Let's get started!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried dill weed</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>

        </ul>
